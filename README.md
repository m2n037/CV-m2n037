## Projects
#### BUG Hexapod Project 
>This project is an exploration of the capability of mechanical components for complex actuation and control. The trajectory of human foot is similar to the alphabet D, rotated anticlockwise 90 degrees. A similar coupler curve can be found in the Hoeken's linkage. An optimized mechanism (in terms of number of links and coupler curve) is designed as a functioning leg and six of them is connected to a rectangular frame with a tripod gait. A single rotating motion is connected to the links through chain drives to control all the legs in a particular gait. The vehicle can be steered using a mechanism that facilitates differential stride for opposing legs.
